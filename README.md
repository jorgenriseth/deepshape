# deepshape
This repository contains source code for a deep reparametrization algorithm for reparametrization of parametric curves and surfaces. It was created as part of my masters thesis in Industrial Mathemetics at NTNU.

See the following notebooks for example usage.
1. [Curve Reparametrization](example-notebooks/curves-reparametrization.ipynb)
2. [Surface Reparametrization](example-notebooks/surfaces-reparametrization.ipynb)
